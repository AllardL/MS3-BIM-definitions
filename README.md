# TiMBIM Definitions
Code InstituteUser Data Centric Development Milestone Project

I made this website to made it easy to lookup BIM related terms and definitions and to let everyone share his/her definitions easily.

## User Experience
I decided to go for a simple not to cluttered design with no background picture. Everyone can easily search for all definitions bases on term, language or editor.

## Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4. Python
5. Flask

## Features to be implemented in future
In future I would like to showcase some tools made for different BIM platforms.

## CONTENT
All content is written by me.
Hereby the general design for the pages.

## Testing
The website is tested on different devices from smartphone to workstation with a 27" screen.
CSS was tested several times on "different devices" using developer tools in different webbrowsers. Using life editing in the webbrowser different settings were tested and improved.

[Freeformatter.com](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html) was using for code validation. ISO-8859-9 setting was used. During testing was mentioned to better use CSS for some settings instead of iframes which I adjusted.

## Deployment
The website is hosted on GitHub pages. However once it is completele and agreed on by my collegues it will also be available on http://www.timbim.eu/
